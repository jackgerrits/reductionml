    Reduction-based machine learning framework

.. div:: sd-mb-5

    ReductionML is a machine learning framework with solutions to a range of
    problems. It revolves around the concept of simplifying problems by breaking
    them down into more manageable components that already have solutions. This
    process is done by `reductions <reductions>`__ as they reduce one problem to
    another. This approach draws inspiration from the `VowpalWabbit
    <https://github.com/VowpalWabbit/vowpal_wabbit>`__, a project I hold in high
    regard and deeply value. In fact, if you are familiar with VowpalWabbit then you
    should be able to pick up ReductionML with ease.
